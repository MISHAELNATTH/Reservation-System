There are two versions of the reservation system for your disposal: 
1. Sandwicheire Libanaise Reservation System.cpp: This provides and ticks all the necessary details mentioned in the project proposal file).
2. GUI_Sandwicheire Libanaise Reservation System: GUI in which only customer_management part is functional, other buttons are just recognised for the continous functioning of the GUI  (But to compile and we need to setup GTK4 environment). Thats why I provided a .exe file along with submission in Junia Learning.
